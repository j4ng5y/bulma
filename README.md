# bulma
A diagram-driven code generation tool.

## Concept
Bulma is (eventually) going to allow users to generate code based on the contents of a diagram. 

The initial use case is generating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) resources for a given network diagram, but this could be
expanded to allow for general diagram-driven code generation, such as building a sequence diagram/class diagram/etc...

Mostly this project exists out of my frustration of out-of-date diagrams.

## Initially Supported Technologies

### Diagrams

* PlantUML:
  * Deployment

### Code Generation

* Terraform

## Future Suppored Technologies (Maybe)

### Diagrams

* Mermaid
* (Others?)

### Code Generation

* Pulumi
* Crossplane
* CloudFormation
* (Others?)
* General Programming Languages
  * Go
  * Python
  * JavaScript/TypeScript

The sky is the limit, if you have a use-case, let me know in the issues.
